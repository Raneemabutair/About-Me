# Lab03 201

**Todayâ€™s lab was very intensefor me it took me a lot of time to think
about it as I continued the updating on yesterday lab (Lab02) about me guessing game, I added some new tags and condition such as:**

* *Added a 6th question to the guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user to guess a number, and giving the user many attempts to try.*

* *Added a 7th question that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array, with many attempted also.*

* *updating some HTML anis CSS.*

* *create a counter to calculate the true answers and give a final result to the user.*
